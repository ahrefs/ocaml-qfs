Bindings to libqfs
==================

Building
--------

The C library lives at https://github.com/quantcast/qfs
After building and installing the C library make sure includes and libraries are visible to the C compiler.

One way to do it :

  ln -s $QFS_DIR/build/release/include/kfs /usr/include/kfs
  cp $QFS_DIR/build/release/lib/*.so /usr/local/lib
  ldconfig

Alternatively, configure `C_INCLUDE_PATH` and `LIBRARY_PATH` accordingly.
